# Library Overview

# Containers

Generic collection of class templates and algorithms to easily implement common datastructures

- [Container List](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container)

## Sequence Containers

Data Structures that can be accessed sequentially

- [ ] array
- [ ] vector
- [ ] deque
- [ ] forward_list
- [ ] list

## Container Adaptors

Different interface for sequential containers

- [x] stack
- [x] queue
- [x] priority_queue

## Associative Containers

Sorted datastructures that can be quickly searched (**O(logn)** complexity)

- [ ] set
- [ ] multiset
- [ ] map
- [ ] multimap

## Unordered Associative Containers

Unsorted (hashed) datastructures that can be quickly searched (**O(1)** amortized, **O(n)** worst-case complexity)

- [ ] unordered_set
- [ ] unordered_multiset
- [x] unordered_map
- [ ] unordered_multimap
